SimpleNotesApp
==============
A simple iPad note taking application created for a project at Bucknell.

The application implements CoreData and a variant of the built-in
UISplitViewConroller created by Matt Gemmell for some additional functionality.

This app was created in 2011 for iOS 4.3 and due to API changes is incompatible
with modern iOS.
